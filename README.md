# yahoo-tsla-selenium-scrapper

This repository contains a Python web scraper built using Selenium for extracting news headlines from a specific website. The scraper is designed to navigate to a target URL, scroll down to load news content, and extract headlines, which are then saved to a CSV file.

Installation
To run the web scraper, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following dependencies:

Selenium
Pandas
You can install the dependencies using pip:
-pip install selenium
-pip install pandas

It was built using Selenium version: 4.15.2

Additionally, you'll need to download the appropriate WebDriver executable for your browser (e.g., Chrome WebDriver for Google Chrome) and ensure it's available in your system PATH or specify its path in the script.

Usage

Run the Python script:
python your_scraper_name.py

The script will launch a web browser, navigate to the target URL, scrape news headlines, and save them to a CSV file named "news_headlines.csv" in the same directory.
